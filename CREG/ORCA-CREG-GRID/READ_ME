how to use convert_wrap_orca12_batcoord.f90 and what does it do?

see end for differences in convert_wrap_orca12_chlorophyll.f90, convert_wrap_orca12_iceini.f90 or convert_wrap_orca025_tmxfields.f90
These explanations are also valid for convert_wrap_orca025_*.f90

0) when to use it
   To get a regional domain containing the northern suture from a global ORCA-grid.

1) how to use it

 - first the script has to adapted to your purpose. 
   You have to give the size of the new domain in x- and y-direction (ni, nj)
   and for its localisation the lowest y-index used (jsta) 
   and the distance of the new western border from the middle of the global domain (in eastward direction; ista)
   Two cases are possible: * marks the coordinates to be given (ista as distance from the middle). 
        a)
        ---------------------------------------
        |   !        !           !        !   |  
        |   !        !           !        !   |
        |   !        !           o---------   |
        |   !        !                        |
        |   ----------           *            |
        |                                     |
        |                                     |
        ---------------------------------------
       
        b)
        ---------------------------------------
        |   !        !           !        !   |  
        |   !        !           !        !   |
        |   ----------           !        !   |
        |                        !        !   |
        |                        *---------   |
        |                                     |
        |                                     |
        ---------------------------------------
   In case a) jdiff has to be given as the distance between * and o. 
              (also:   2*(jsta-1)+jdiff+nj = 2*ny-3  with ny: global size in y-dimension) 
   In case b) jdiff=0.
   
 - There is a specific treatment for the variable 'Bathymetry' to fill unconnected (or undesired) parts of the ocean. 
   It should be adapted to your purpose. The coordinates are with respect to the new regional domain.

 - compile script using the Makefile
   >>  make convert_wrap_orca12_batcoord
   will create executable in ../bin directory

 - run executable
   >>  ./../bin/convert_wrap_orca12_batcoord <coordinates_file> <coordinates_outfilename>
   twice
   >>  ./../bin/convert_wrap_orca12_batcoord <bathymetry_file> <bathymetry_outfilename>


2) what it does
   
 - The script loops through all variables (1-dimensional variables are marked as undesired and are skipped) 
   and chooses the wrapping method due to the grid of the variable.

   WARNING:
   This works if the variables have the names and the order that is expected. 
   For files containing other variables these parts may have to be adapted!!!

 - The wrapping first cuts off the unused southern part of the global domain (south of *) 
   and cuts vertically down the middle, to connect the two parts at the northern suture
   building a temporary domain h1. 
   In the connecting process the uppermost 2 rows of the right hand part are eliminated 
   as well as the top row of the left hand part.

      a)
            ----------   |
            !        !   |
            !        !   |
            !        !   |
            !        !   |
       -------------------  
            !        !   |
            !        !   |
            o---------   |
                         |
            *            |

      b)
                         |
                         |
            ----------   |
            !        !   |
            !        !   |
       -------------------  
            !        !   |
            !        !   |
            !        !   |
            !        !   |
            *---------   |

   The northern part is shifted relative to the T-grid for
   the U-grid  (1 in x dir)
   the V-grid  (1 in y dir)
   the F-grid  (1 in both x and y dir)
   in order to connect the correct grid points and get a seemless transition at the northern suture.

 - then the new domain (hnew) is cut out from the temporary h1. 
   (western, eastern and remaining southern/northern boundary depending on jdiff)

 - in case of the bathymetry, the unwanted seas are filled in now.



3) how does convert_wrap_orca12_chlorophyll.f90 differ?

 - The chlorophyl data is given as monthly mean values. Therefore a monthly loop is added.
 
 - The wrapping methods are reduced to the T-grid. 

 - Detection of global grid dimension and skipping of variables are adapted to the variable names 


4) how does convert_wrap_orca12_iceini.f90 differ?

 - The wrapping methods are reduced to the T-grid. 

 - Detection of global grid dimension and skipping of variables are adapted to the variable names 

 - After convert_wrap_orca12_iceini further steps are necessary to create a usable file 
   (at least in our case. Please check if necessary before blindly following the list):
   
   + sea ice cover has to be turned into lead fraction and
     ice surface temperature has to be converted from Celsius to Kelvin
     >>  ncap2 -s "ileadfra=1-ileadfra; iicetemp=iicetemp+273; isnowthi=isnowthi; iicethic=iicethic; nav_lon=nav_lon; nav_lat=nav_lat" <infile> <outfile>
   + the variable names have to be changed
     >>  ncrename -v ileadfra,frld <filename>
     >>  ncrename -v iicetemp,sist <filename>
     >>  ncrename -v iicethic,hicif <filename>
     >>  ncrename -v isnowthi,hsnif <filename>

   + the 3 constant inner temperature fields have to be added from old ice initialisation file (or not?)
     >>  ncks -v tbif1,tbif2,tbif3 <old_ice_initialisation> <new_ice_initialisation>
     and choose a for append
     
5) how does convert_wrap_orca025_tmxfields differ?

 - Currently it exists only for 025 grid

 - It is adapted for input files on the extended ORCA025 grid that includes Antarctica

 - The wrapping methods are reduced to the T-grid.

 - Skipped variables are changed
