## Env. and source code used to perform an ON-LINE exp. using CREG025.L75 configuration <br>
>
>  It relies on NEMO release 4.2.2 & DCM/4.2.0 on Datarmor <br>
>  One experiment has been done over 1 month starting in 1979 with few daily outputs for the biogeochemistry <br>
>  Data along BDYS are based on CMEMS re-analysis: GLORYS12V1 daily and FREEBIORYS2V4 for the dynamics and biogeochemstry respectively<br>
>  Surface forcing relies on ERA5 dataset including a 2m air temperature correction. This correction (from Adam BLAKER NOC) is based on a seasonal cycle anomaly betwenn ERA5 and JRA55. <br>
>  Only the air temperature has been corrected <br>
>  Bio initial condition for few variables rely on the FREEBIORYS2V4 re-analysis <br>
